The R totalcensus package makes it easy to find out the age of people in your neighborhood, the house price in your town, and the ethnic composition of your city. It extracts data directly from the original summary files of Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys, and hence you won't miss any piece of data the Census Bureau offers in the summary files. The summary files contain thousands of social, economic, and demographic variables in dozens of geographic entities, which can be quickly explored with the totalcensus package.
