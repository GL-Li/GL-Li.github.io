This package draws TIGER census boundaries on ggmap with a single function `geom_boundary()` and plot census data on map with `geom_census()`. As extensions to ggplot2, `geom_boundary()` and `geom_census()` work similarly to native ggplot2 `geom_xxxx()` functions. It currently draws boundaries of states, counties, county subdivisions, tracts, block groups, zip code tabulation areas, and congressional districts. More geographies are being added.
