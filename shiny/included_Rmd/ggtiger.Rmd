<a href="https://github.com/GL-Li/ggtiger" target="_blank"><h3>ggtiger package</h3></a> 

This package draws TIGER census boundaries on ggmap with a single function geom_boundary() and plot census data on map with geom_census(). As extensions to ggplot2, geom_boundary() and geom_census() work similarly to native ggplot2 geom_xxxx() functions. It currently draws boundaries of states, counties, county subdivisions, tracts, block groups, zip code tabulation areas, and congressional districts. More geographies are being added.
