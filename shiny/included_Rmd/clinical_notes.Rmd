A full machine learning project from data collection to model deployment. Clinical notes were scraped from [mtsamples.com](https://www.mtsamples.com/). Medical named entities were extracted with [Amazon Comprehension Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/) and [medaCy](https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy). Features were extracted with term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) technique. The clinical notes were analyzed with principle component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and K-means clustering. Predictive models were built with support vector machine, XGBoost, and neural network. A best performed support vector machine model was deployed to predict specialties of new clinical notes.
